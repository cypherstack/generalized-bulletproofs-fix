# generalized-bulletproofs-fix

## Notes on Bulletproof Generalizations

This repository contains a single PDF with a draft technical report intended for Monero Research Lab, and related to the correction of certain incorrect generalizations of Bulletproofs-style proving systems.

These changes are important to security in upcoming full-chain membership proofs for Monero, but the report rehashes older information, and is likely not suitable for peer-reviewed publication.

The document is a work in progress and is being shared primarily for limited review and reference. A final, complete version which will be ready for citation is forthcoming. 

## Contents

- `generalized_bulletproofs_fix_draft.pdf` — Notes, results, and proofs concerning issues in proposed extensions of Bulletproofs.

## Status

This is an early draft, but results, notation, and scope are not likely to change. A change log will be included in the event that modifications are made.

## License

MIT License for now until Cypher Stack decides on a different choice.
